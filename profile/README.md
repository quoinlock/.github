# Welcome to Quoin 👋

LOCK is a game changing application to help small and indie presses manage product listings of their titles across the web.  Provide us a list of ISBN's and we'll do the rest.  

Quion is a company that shares the values of publishers who want to share incredible authors and their creations with the world.  We're not some wierd Silicon Valley VC backed startup... we're publishers like you.

Visit us at [quoinlock.com](https://quoinlock.com), our beta will open soon.

A 'quoin' ("coin") is a wedge used by typesetters to lock text into a type form so that it remains firmly in place during the printing process.  In modern digital publishing managing Ingram has simplified the distribution of books to nearly ever bookseller on earth... but what small press has the time to track, validate, and manage changes across all the hundreds of bookseller websites?  We can help you keep an eye on the big bad web out there to give you visibility into all your product listings, to put some control back in your hands so that you can focus on publishing great work and supporting your authors.
